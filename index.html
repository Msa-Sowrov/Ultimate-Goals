                <h1>Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup</h1>
                <p>In preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Qatar is constructing 8 breathtaking stadiums at a total
                    cost of $10 billion USD. The stadiums have a wide range of designs based on Qatari and Islamic
                    culture. They are located in Doha and Al Khor, Qatar. They each contain at least 40,000 seats, and
                    have state of the art facilities and landscaping surrounding them. The venues are magnificent pieces
                    of engineering, and will hopefully serve as fantastic venues for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
                    Unfortunately, the event is very controversial as it has been connected to corruption and terrible
                    conditions for migrant workers.</p>
